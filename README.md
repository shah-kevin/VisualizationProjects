# VisualizationProject

I created this PowerBI Dashboard based on the Excel data sources I extracted from Kaggle.

This is a preview of some of my dashboard design language, given the constraints of staying within the PowerBI Visualization Range.

This Design can be further improved using Figma Files for detailed control.

I meticulously clean the visuals based on the business objectives that can only be achieved using stakeholder communication and interactions.

In this cleaning process, I make sure every minor inconvenience is addressed to improve speed from analytics to action/communication
